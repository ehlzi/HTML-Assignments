**HTML** stands for **H**yperText **M**arkup **L**anguage and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.

Most **HTML** elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements.
The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.

- Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing `<body>` tags.
  
- Headings and sub-headings, `<h1> to <h6>` tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.

- `<p>`, `<span>` and `<div>` tags specify text or blocks.

- The `<em>` and `<strong>` tags are used to emphasize text.

- Line breaks are created with the `<br>` tag.
  
- Ordered lists `(<ol>)` are numbered and unordered lists `(<ul>)` are bulleted.
  
- Images `(<img>)` and videos `(<video>)` can be added by linking to an existing source.

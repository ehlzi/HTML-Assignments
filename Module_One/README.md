# Elements and Structure

HTML is the skeleton of all web pages, providing structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Itâ€™s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. 

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks.

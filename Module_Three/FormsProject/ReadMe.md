Forms are great for collecting information on users, like job applications or insightful surveys. However, we can also stretch our creative muscles and have a little fun with forms. 

For this project, weâ€™ll use our knowledge of the HTML `<form>` and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!

Make a `<form>` capable of collecting the correct information so that the newly crafted story makes sense!
